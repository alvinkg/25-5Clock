# 25 + 5 Clock

This is the last of five projects for the FreeCodeCamp Frontend Certification I completed.  It gave me quite a bit of work as it had more moving parts that the other projects. I found myself referring to a few projects in youtube and the web, gravitating to this one example by [Alberto Montalesi](https://inspiredwebdev.com/create-pomodoro-clock/#the-final-pomodoro-clock-result).
His code was very clean and he had a visually appealing pomodoro clock with a circular progress bar.
Having completed the challenge to complete certification I added the font awesome icons and the progress bar.  However, found it challenging to toggle the icons using a separate function and opted to embed the code directly in existing code. For some reason the simple choice of fa fa-refresh was denied to me so I had to use a fa-retweet instead.
For some reason incorporating these changes affected my code and it again failed the story#8 of the timer section.

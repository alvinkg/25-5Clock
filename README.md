# 25 + 5 Clock

This is the second of five projects for the FreeCodeCamp Frontend Certification.
While I have completed the functionality and removed all the bugs, the code still has about eight fails based on the auto tests.  
Also it is quite barebones.  So I will be working on it further to get it pass the finish line.  
In the meantime I am keeping it here as a best practice.
